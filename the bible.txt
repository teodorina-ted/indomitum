this was the concept and what i call THE BIBLE of this app:
DONE.
now, go back to my requirements and full concept, remember the landing page must have also the scan a plant button and a login for the clients, besides the things ive mention before.
So, this app must be dedicated for the seed collectors. those seeds must be added in a small bag that have a qr code. The seed collector is introducing the data about the seed to a crm that later will serve to sell to the client. The client later will have access to the plant card *pdf with details* by scanning the existing qr code. my client requested an ios version first so we focus forst on it, maybe later we develop also for android. i need a perfect and responsive design.
in order to reach this process, we need to create a dashboard for the admin <=> seed collector, that will add a plant by the following steps (mobile parameters as the collectors will use iphones to ADD the plant):
1. scan the existing qr through the phone cam, qr will be automatically detected and added
2. take the picture of the plant the seed was collected or add it from the gallery/files/etc add the name 
3.  confirm the map live location by city, country street etc and add notes optionally and SUBMIT

by submitting this, the dashboard will have the following columns:
1. name 
2. id which will be the qr link that will have actually open the plant pdf
3. date automatically added by submit button
4. added by (admin or other plant/seed collector ID)
5. country
6. city
7. street 
8. zip code
9. lattitude and longitude ad coordinated *linked that will open the location on a default map
10. notes

then this dashboard which must have features as a CRM must have:
box selection
filters like the sheets in excel for example by date by alphabet etc
search bar
export 
delete bunch by checking the boxes

any card box must have an individual id and a row in the dashboard admin crm 

what else is unclear?
